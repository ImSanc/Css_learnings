# Pseudo-class

- A pseudo-class in CSS is like a special keyword you add to a selector to style it when it's in a certain state â€” like when a user hovers over it, clicks it, or when an input is focused.

- You write it with a colon <b>:</b> before the pseudo-class name.

eg:- 
- :hover is a pseudo-class that applies when you hover your mouse over the button.


        button:hover {
        background-color: blue;
        }


- :focus happens when you click into the input box. it is used when a page is read throw a reader or user uses tab only


        input:focus {
        border: 2px solid green;
        }

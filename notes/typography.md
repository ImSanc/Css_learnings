# Font and text are two different things 


### Font-family
- We can use font family where we can provide fonts and its fall back.
- There is a good chance that user system doesn't have the font so we provide multiple family so that it can pick one in case they dont have the primiary one.


        body {
            font-family : 'Courier New' , Courier ,
            monospace
        }

#### Note:  for custom font style we can use google fonts and  select a font family from there.

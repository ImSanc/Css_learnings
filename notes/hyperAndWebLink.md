## Hyper link and web link
- Hypertext links (or just "hyperlinks") are any clickable links inside text that take you to another document, another part of the same document, or even start something like an email. Hypertext is about text that links to other text.

- Web links (or "URLs" on the web) are a type of hyperlink that specifically point to a resource on the internet, like a webpage, an image, a video, etc.

### In short:
ðŸ‘‰ All web links are hyperlinks, but not all hyperlinks are web links.

#### Example:

- A link in a Word document that jumps to a later page = hyperlink, but not a web link.

- A link on a webpage that takes you to google.com = both a hyperlink and a web link.
